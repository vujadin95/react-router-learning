This is tutorial that I found on YouTube by Net Ninja (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMQ2QARHPo0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iVKmtNuCeIswnQ97in2GGf&index=1);

First, for starting this project, you have to run command 'npm install';

After that you need to run development server for frontend, using command 'npm run dev';

For backend server, ie. to fetch data, you need to install json-server package, using cammand 'npm install -g json-server';

After installing json-server, run commadn 'json-server -p 4000 -w ./data/db.json'
